This repository demonstrates a common mistake when using MongoDB's `updateOne` method.  The provided `bug.js` example attempts to increment the `age` field directly without using the `$set` or another update operator. This results in the entire document being replaced instead of just updating the specified field. The solution in `bugSolution.js` corrects this by properly employing the `$inc` operator within `$set` to increment the age field.
